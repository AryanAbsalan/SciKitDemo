Here are several common terminology used in machine learning. 

Coefficient:

The coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change 
in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other variables constant.
In simple linear regression with one independent variable, 
the coefficient is the slope of the regression line. 
It tells us how the dependent variable changes on average 
for each unit increase in the independent variable.

In multiple linear regression with multiple independent variables, 
each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change
in the corresponding independent variable, 
while holding all other variables constant.
The coefficient can be positive, indicating a positive relationship 
where an increase in the independent variable leads to an increase in the dependent variable, 
or negative, indicating a negative relationship 
where an increase in the independent variable leads to a decrease in the dependent variable.
For example:
If we observe a negative relationship between temperature and electricity consumption, 
it means that as the temperature increases, the electricity consumption tends to decrease. 
This implies that colder temperatures are associated with higher electricity consumption, 
while warmer temperatures are associated with lower electricity consumption.

The intercept: 
also known as the constant term, 
is the value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.
In simple linear regression, 
the intercept is the point where the regression line intersects the y-axis.
For example, 
if the coefficient is $100, it means that, 
on average, each additional square foot increases the house price by $100, 
assuming all other factors remain constant.


Log Loss Calculation:
Log loss measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels 
by taking the logarithm of the predicted probabilities.
The formula for log loss is: log_loss = -(y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p)), 
where y is the actual class label (0 or 1) 
and 
p is the predicted probability.
The log loss is calculated for each instance in the dataset, and 
the average or sum of these losses is typically used as the overall log loss for the model.

Log loss aims to penalize incorrect predictions more severely than correct predictions, and 
it rewards models that assign high probabilities to the correct class.
Lower log loss values indicate better model performance, with a perfect model achieving a log loss of 0.
Higher log loss values indicate poorer model performance, and 
log loss can increase indefinitely as the predicted probabilities move further away from the true class labels.
Log loss is widely used for model evaluation, model selection, and parameter tuning 
in binary classification tasks. 
It provides a measure of how well the predicted probabilities align with the true class labels and 
can help compare different models or variations of a model to identify the best-performing one.

Recall focuses on the coverage of the positive instances, indicating 
how effectively the model captures all positive instances.
Precision focuses on the quality of the positive predictions, indicating 
how likely a positive prediction is to be correct.
