There are several common regression algorithms used in machine learning. 
Here are some of the popular ones:

1.Linear Regression: 
Linear regression is a simple and widely used regression algorithm that models the relationship 
between the input features and the target variable using a linear equation. 
It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

2.Polynomial Regression: 
Polynomial regression extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms to the equation. 
It can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

3.Decision Tree Regression: 
Decision tree regression builds a decision tree-based model to predict the target variable. 
It partitions the feature space into regions and assigns a constant value to each region.

4.Random Forest Regression: 
Random forest regression is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. 
It averages the predictions of individual decision trees 
to obtain the final result, providing better generalization and reducing overfitting.

5.Support Vector Regression (SVR): 
SVR is a regression version of support vector machines (SVM). 
It uses a kernel function to transform the input features into a higher-dimensional space 
and finds a hyperplane that maximizes the margin while minimizing the error.

6.Gradient Boosting Regression: 
Gradient boosting regression is another ensemble method that combines multiple weak regression models 
to create a strong predictive model. 
It builds the model iteratively by minimizing a loss function using gradient descent.

7.Neural Network Regression: 
Neural network regression uses artificial neural networks to model 
the relationship between the input features and the target variable.
It can capture complex non-linear relationships but may require more data and computational resources.

Here are some real examples of how regression algorithms are used:

Real Estate: 
Regression models can be used to predict housing prices based on 
features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors. 
This helps real estate agents, buyers, and sellers make informed decisions.

Finance: 
Regression algorithms are used to predict stock prices, market trends, and investment returns. 
Financial institutions use regression models to analyze risk, optimize portfolios, 
and make investment decisions.

Marketing and Sales: 
Regression models are employed to forecast sales based on
advertising expenditure, customer demographics, pricing, and other factors. 
This helps businesses plan marketing campaigns, optimize pricing strategies, and estimate demand.

Healthcare: 
Regression algorithms are used in medical research to predict patient outcomes, such as
disease progression, treatment response, or mortality rates. 
Regression models can also be utilized to estimate the impact of various factors on health outcomes.

Insurance: 
Regression models are employed in the insurance industry for risk assessment and premium calculation. 
They help estimate the likelihood of an event occurring, such as 
car accidents or health issues, based on relevant factors.

Manufacturing: 
Regression algorithms can be used to predict 
product quality, identify defects, and optimize production processes. 
By analyzing various factors, such as temperature, pressure, 
or ingredient proportions, regression models help improve manufacturing efficiency.

Energy Consumption: 
Regression models are used to predict and analyze energy consumption patterns. 
They help energy providers forecast demand, optimize energy distribution, 
and implement energy-saving measures.


The main difference between Regression and Classification algorithms 
Regression algorithms are used to predict the continuous values such as price, salary, age, etc. 
Classification algorithms are used to predict/Classify the discrete values such as Male or Female, True or False, Spam or Not Spam, etc.

The regression Algorithm can be further divided into Linear and Non-linear Regression.	
The Classification algorithms can be divided into Binary Classifier and Multi-class Classifier.
